# My Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This is a webpage I made to help organize and document any notes I needed for the Coding Bootcamp Prework. 
This webpage serves as a study guide, and cache for any information I needed, or might need in the future.
I learned many things I hadn't previously known. Including but not limited to:
- How to structure a webpage in HTML
- CSS Styling and design
- JavaScript variables, commands, arrays, and functions
- Chrome Dev Tools, ie the console

## Usage

This webpage can be used to find notes and information about the different topics in the Coding Bootcamp Prework.
The topics are organized in order of usage when creating a webpage.
Opening the webpage's console will display the four different topics, and also pick on at random for you to study!
